## Installation
Please follow the install guide closely before asking questions about the installation.
Always download the latest release and NOT the sourcecode!
### [Install guide](https://vimeo.com/229296849)
#### On windows there's a chance that you'll need to install [Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685) because the plugin won't load otherwise
